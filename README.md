# One-Time Password (OTP)

## PHP web based Rest API

#### [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)

The idea came from an interview where I've had to make such an web app without a framework.

Please, review and the [front end Angular app](https://github.com/koredalin/phone-number-validator-fe-ng).

### Used technologies
* PHP7.4,
* MySQL,
* Dependency injection,
* League Route,
* Laminas Diactoros,
* Laminas HttpHandlerRunner,
* Symfony Validator,
* Request/ Response DTO pattern used in the controllers,
* Doctrine,
* Doctrine Migrations,
* Codeception functional tests,
* Repository pattern for access to Doctrine repositories.
